This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)

The original web page is awful, if you have to decide which tours you want to subscribe and when. I once wrote an alternative frontend, but I never finished and it doesn't work anymore with the current data structure.

Let me know if you are using this data for something.
